## 🎮 About the Game

Talazar, the orc king, has abducted the dwarven queen and hidden the enchanted gemstones that once protected the Kingdom of Mornhiem. It's up to you to explore the caverns, recover the lost gemstones, and reforge the Sword of Mornhiem. But beware — without all the gemstones, you stand no chance against Talazar.
